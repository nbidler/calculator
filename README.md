# WHAT WAS LEARNED
>   Designing a project from scratch, structuring logic far in advance of any coding, error-checking user input to prevent crashes or similar, input parsing.

# TO DO
> Remake entirely object-oriented.
> Include keyboard inputs.
> Improve input parsing.
> Include order of operations.

# ADDITIONAL FEATURES ADDED
